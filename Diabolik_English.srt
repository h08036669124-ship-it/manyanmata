1
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:51,321
CLERVILLE
THE END OF THE 1960s

2
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,561
NATIONAL BANK OF CLERVILLE

3
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,721
Calling all cars!

4
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,041
A black Jaguar has exited
the back of the bank!

5
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,361
He's turned left on to Via dei Platani.

6
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:34,721
This is Zebra-13, we're rapidly
approaching from Via del Corso.

7
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,881
Go! Faster!

8
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,841
He's turned on to Via delle Mimose.
Zebra-13, cut him off!

9
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,401
We have him trapped!

10
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,041
Stop!

11
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,161
Calling all cars!
The Jaguar has evaded us.

12
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,441
He's on Via delle Camelie.

13
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:46,161
We're outside the Embassy of Beglait,
we'll be there in a few seconds.

14
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,441
Suspect spotted on Via della Cascata.
We're on his tail!

15
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,081
Damn!

16
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,441
What the...

17
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,401
Gas!

18
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:41,121
Hold your breath.

19
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,161
That's him.

20
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,761
What the blazes, Inspector?

21
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:22,881
Diabolik.

22
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:01,601
A FEW MONTHS LATER

23
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,881
Minister, you don't mean to say
you won't be our guest tomorrow!

24
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,001
My dear Count,
your life is one endless holiday.

25
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,201
Lucky you.

26
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:56,641
But my duties dictate that
I return to Clerville.

27
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,521
Why not send Giorgio?

28
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,841
He's your deputy.
It's what he's there for.

29
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,841
To a meeting with the Prime Minister?

30
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,321
It wouldn't be appropriate.

31
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,001
It's a real shame.

32
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:13,521
I would've been happy to let you
try out my new Remington.

33
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:17,121
I had them attach
an extremely powerful viewfinder!

34
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,001
Pardon me.

35
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,001
Where's he off to?

36
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,201
Eva! Finally.

37
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,401
- Welcome.
- Thank you, Giorgio.

38
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,281
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

39
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,401
You look... stunning.

40
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,081
As always.

41
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,561
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

42
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,401
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let me introduce you.

43
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,921
This way.

44
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,681
Mrs Duncan.

45
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,641
Lady Kant, I presume.

46
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,481
- Good evening, thank you for inviting me.
- Giorgio.

47
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,121
If all the girls in South Africa
are so beautiful,

48
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,401
I understand why you go there so often!

49
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,601
- I'm actually from Clerville.
- Ah!

50
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:11,521
Yes.
Eva spent many years in South Africa,

51
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,961
but now she has finally decided
to return home.

52
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,441
Giorgio!

53
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:17,761
Over here.

54
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,841
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to introduce me?

55
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,161
Lady Kant, Minister.

56
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,641
Enchanted.

57
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,121
Years ago, during a hunting expedition
in South Africa,

58
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,081
I met a Lord Kant.

59
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,201
Anthony, if I'm not mistaken.
A relation of yours?

60
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:39,241
- Perhaps your father?
- He was my husband.

61
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:40,761
Was?

62
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,521
Sadly, he died. Almost a year ago.

63
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:46,881
I'm most sorry.

64
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,761
He was a magnificent hunter.

65
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,761
May I ask how...

66
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,601
An accident.
On a big game hunting trip.

67
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,441
Good heavens, big game!

68
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:02,761
Thank goodness you men
only hunt roe deer.

69
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,721
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Emma.

70
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,921
- Your husband hunts some beasts
that are far more dangerous. - Indeed!

71
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:14,521
Minister, will you ever manage
to catch Diabolik?

72
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,281
Most certainly.

73
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:21,361
As Minister of Justice, my priority is
the safety of every citizen.

74
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,521
Yes, that criminal
has overstepped every mark.

75
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,361
He's spreading fear
throughout the State of Clerville.

76
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:32,081
But we are determined to stop him.
At any cost.

77
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,001
He sounds like a demon
more than a criminal.

78
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:38,161
Excuse me, are you talking about
someone who actually exists?

79
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,001
My dear Lady Kant,

80
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:44,441
I can only hope that you never come
face-to-face with him.

81
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,161
To meet Diabolik...

82
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,401
means meeting death.

83
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:53,521
Enough talking about that monster,
or tonight I'll have nightmares!

84
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,441
You're right, Mrs Duncan.

85
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:58,641
To apologise, I promise

86
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:02,841
that tomorrow I'll bring you
the youngest roe deer I've ever killed.

87
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,281
Already skinned and ready for the oven!

88
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:14,401
Forgive me for insisting,
but why don't you stay with me tonight?

89
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,001
I've got an enormous house all to myself.

90
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:20,321
It wouldn't be appropriate, Giorgio.

91
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,681
You're going a little fast.

92
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,161
At least let me give you a lift.

93
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,241
Thank you, but the hotel's nearby.

94
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:35,841
And I feel like a walk.

95
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,401
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

96
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:48,161
- Lady Kant?
- Yes.

97
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,361
Inspector Ginko. I need to have a word.

98
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,841
City of Clerville Police Force?

99
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,441
Don't tell me you came all this way
just for me?

100
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,841
I came because it's my duty to warn you.

101
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,481
Warn me?

102
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,521
Of what?

103
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,041
Diabolik.

104
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:13,881
So this mysterious criminal who
everyone is talking about really exists.

105
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,281
Of course.

106
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,961
Did you think it was an urban legend?

107
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,521
I'm certain he's planning a new heist.

108
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,801
Since you're telling me,
you think he's after the Pink Diamond.

109
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:28,441
Such a valuable gem would be
an irresistible temptation for Diabolik.

110
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,401
How could Diabolik know about
me and the Pink Diamond?

111
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,561
He manages to know everything.

112
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,721
Always.

113
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:40,361
Please, Inspector,
don't you start talking about Diabolik

114
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:42,041
as if he's a supernatural being!

115
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,481
No, no magic, Lady Kant.

116
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,401
He's just a man,
but an extraordinarily talented one.

117
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:53,881
As extraordinary as he may be,
I don't see how he could know about me.

118
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:56,601
I've only been here a few days.

119
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,001
I suspect he has a web of informers
working for him everywhere.

120
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,681
Here in Bellair. In South Africa.

121
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,801
You suspect?

122
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,441
Therefore, you're not certain.

123
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:16,441
We've carried out extensive investigations
in the criminal underworld,

124
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,321
but nobody ever talks.

125
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,121
Maybe because they all know
that to betray Diabolik...

126
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,761
means death.

127
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,361
Aren't you exaggerating, Inspector?

128
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,281
Believe me, Lady Kant,

129
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:31,721
if Diabolik intends
to steal the Pink Diamond,

130
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,281
your life may be in danger.

131
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,041
Do you want me to run back to South Africa
like a frightened little girl?

132
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:39,401
No.

133
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:42,801
I'll have some undercover agents
watch your hotel.

134
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,001
With maximum discretion,
no one will even notice them.

135
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:48,761
I see.

136
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:53,321
You intend to set a trap for him,
using me as the bait.

137
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,241
You are a most unique woman.

138
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:05,961
- If that's a compliment, thank you.
- No, an observation.

139
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,521
So, where will you be staying
in Clerville?

140
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,401
The Hotel Excelsior.

141
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:14,521
And the diamond?

142
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,201
It's on its way,
a special consignment from South Africa.

143
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,921
It'll be waiting for me
when I get to Clerville in two days.

144
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,761
Where will it be kept?

145
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:25,041
Officially, in the hotel manager's safe.

146
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,881
But it'll only hold an empty box.

147
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,441
The real diamond will be deposited
by the South African security guards

148
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,921
in another safe.

149
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,881
In my room.

150
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,521
But only the manager of the Excelsior
and I know this.

151
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,321
And now you, naturally.

152
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,601
Good.

153
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,161
Thank you for your time, Lady Kant.

154
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,521
One last thing.

155
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,601
Please don't tell anyone about
our conversation.

156
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:08,241
And should we meet again,
act as though it's the first time.

157
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,281
Why so much mystery?

158
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,281
No one knows the true face of Diabolik.

159
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,481
He could be anyone.

160
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,921
The waiter passing by.

161
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,201
The man behind me with the newspaper.

162
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,521
Or the man who has just come in.

163
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,761
Even one of my most trusted men.

164
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,841
You don't say?

165
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,961
He could be anyone.

166
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,881
Which is why I'd prefer if our meeting...

167
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,481
remained a secret.

168
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,321
In that case, Inspector...

169
00:15:57,601 --> 00:15:59,841
it's my pleasure never to have met you.

170
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,281
And who gets to do it?

171
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,441
The manager made it absolutely clear,

172
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,521
this special task will be
Roberto's responsibility.

173
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,481
Why does he always get the easy jobs?!

174
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:06,001
What do you expect?
He's the manager's pet!

175
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,081
If the manager chose me to be
Lady Kant's personal concierge,

176
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,441
the reason is obvious.

177
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,561
Oh yeah, and what would that be?

178
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:15,961
Well, just take a look in the mirror.

179
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:19,801
- Listen to Mister Handsome!
- Our very own movie star!

180
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,281
You should be grateful to have a job!

181
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,481
This is only a stopgap job for me.
I've got much bigger plans.

182
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:27,961
I'm not like you two.

183
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:32,521
And what exactly does that mean,
"I'm not like you two"?

184
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:37,521
My dear fellows, unlike you,
I'm not going to die a concierge.

185
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,201
Sure, keep on dreaming!

186
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,601
STAFF ENTRANCE

187
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,481
- Goodnight, José.
- Goodnight.

188
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:29,001
If the manager chose me to be Lady Kant's
personal concierge, the reason is obvious.

189
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:35,081
If the manager chose me to be
Lady Kant's personal concierge,

190
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,841

191
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:46,401

Lady Kant's personal concierge,

193
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,321

194
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:01,201
If the manager chose me to be Lady Kant's
personal concierge, the reason is obvious.

195

If the manager chose me to be
Lady Kant's personal concierge,

196
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,041
the reason is obvious.

197
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:16,041
If the manager chose me to be Lady Kant's
personal concierge, the reason is obvious.

198
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,481
If the manager chose me to be
Lady Kant's personal concierge,

199
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,161
the reason is obvious.

200

202

203
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:45,121

204

If the manager chose me to be
Lady Kant's personal concierge,

205
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:50,801
the reason is obvious.

206
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,321
If you only knew
how much we envy you in Lesan.

207
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,561
Me and all the girls at the hospital.

208
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,761
We all dream of a man like Walter Dorian.

209
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:24,681
One who takes us to live in the big city.

210
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,641
One who allows us to quit our jobs.

211
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,161
Elisabeth.

212
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:36,041
Hey, is everything all right?

213
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,681
I hardly ever see him.

214
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,841
He's always away.

215
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:46,761
Sometimes he comes home,

216
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,281
stays for a few hours,

217
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,161
and then leaves again.

218
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,401
- Oh God! Is he cheating on you?
- No!

219
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,401
It's his work.

220
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,081
He explained it to me.

221
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,281
What does he do?

222
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,321
Well...

223
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,721
I didn't really understand all that well.

224
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,001
Business, he says.

225
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,761
- But he earns a lot of money!
- Yes.

226
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,521
It's all right then!

227
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,041
You know what I say?
I'd swap with you in a second!

228
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:30,601
Come now,
you've got everything you could wish for:

229
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,241
a beautiful home,
a man who's never around...

230
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,761
What more could you ask for?

231
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,361
I want Walter!

232
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,841
I'm only happy when I'm with him.

233
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:05,201
Has anyone seen Roberto?

234
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,281
No, sir.

235
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:09,721
Where the hell is he?
Lady Kant is almost here!

236
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:12,041
May I be of assistance, sir?

237
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,721
No.

238
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,961
Ada! Have you seen Roberto?

239
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,721
- No, sir.
- I don't understand, he's not here...

240
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:25,481
- Good morning, sir.
- Roberto!

241
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:29,401
- Sorry for being late.
- Come quickly. Lady Kant is on her way.

242
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:47,281
Thank you.

243
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,841
- Lady Kant, I'm the hotel manager.
- Nice to meet you.

244
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,401
- Welcome to the Excelsior.
- Thank you.

245
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,001
You can check-in at the reception desk.

246
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:02,601
- How was your trip? Do you need anything?
- Not at the moment, thank you.

247
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:06,681
If you do need anything, just ask Roberto,
your personal concierge.

248
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,041
After you.

249
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:26,121
A latest model safe:

250
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:28,601
reinforced steel
with an ultra-silent mechanism.

251
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,361
Making it practically impossible
for anyone to identify the combination.

252
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:33,881
Wonderful.

253
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,721
Only the best for
a client such as yourself, Lady Kant.

254
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:38,721
Go ahead.

255
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:48,881
I'll send Roberto up at once
to prepare a bath for you.

256
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,361
Hello?

257
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,401
Yes. Put him through, please.

258
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,121
Giorgio.

259
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:57,961
Hi.

260
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,281
Yes, fine.
I'm just about to have a bath.

261
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:01,641
How are you?

262
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,001
Where will we see each other tonight?

263
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:08,561
Your place?

264
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,481
Are you sure? Wouldn't it be better...

265
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:16,161
I understand.
You're right, it might be inconvenient.

266
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,121
Fine, your house at half-past nine.
What's the address?

267
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:22,761
Yes...

268
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:25,721
Yes.

269
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,521
Great.

270
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,961
See you later, Giorgio.
And thanks for the invitation.

271
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:41,441
Lady Kant.

272
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,521
Your bath is ready.

273
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,961
- Thank you.
- Do you need anything else?

274
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,201
No.

275
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,281
Thank you, Roberto. You may go.

276
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,921
For anything at all, I'll be here
in the hotel until six o'clock.

277
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,681
Simply ring the bell.

278
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,401
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

279
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,321
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, ma'am. Goodnight.

280
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:52,881
Goodbye.

281
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,081
Walter!

282
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:55,441
Darling, you're here.

283
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:03,121
You're finally here.

284
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:08,401
Calm yourself.

285
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,561
Calm yourself.

286
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,121
Unfortunately,
I have to go out now, Elisabeth.

287
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:21,601
But you just got back.

288
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,321
- And you weren't at home.
- I know, you're right.

289
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,001
I'm sorry, forgive me!
Please don't go.

290
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:30,121
- Stay with me a while.
- I haven't got the time.

291
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:36,601
Let's at least eat together!

292
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,441
I'll cook something.

293
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,921
- I'll be quick!
- Elisabeth.

294
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,801
You know I don't like it
when you act like this.

295
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,881
Yes, I know.

296
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,561
Walter.

297
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,761
You'll come back later, won't you?

298
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:03,201
I'll be late. Don't wait up for me.

299
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,761
Are you trying to get me drunk?

300
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:34,481
Oh, come now,
you've only had a glass of wine.

301
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:36,321
And it's enough.

302
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,041
Thank you, Giorgio.

303
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,921
For a toast.

304
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:44,521
All right then.

305
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:49,401
To Eva...

306
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,241
the most beautiful woman in the world.

307
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,961
You're exaggerating.

308
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,441
For me you are!

309
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,561
Giorgio, please.

310
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,201
Forgive me.

311
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,401
It's just having you here, Eva,
is a dream come true.

312
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,441
A dream.

313
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,201
It's been a nice evening.

314
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:16,881
Don't ruin it.

315
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:57,641
Try to scream and I'll kill you.

316
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,921
You're wasting your time.

317
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:06,521
Diabolik.

318
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,001
What does that mean?

319
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,481
The Pink Diamond is fake.

320
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:24,561
Against the wall, move it.

321
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,921
It's a perfect copy.

322
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,401
Impossible for the human eye
to tell the difference.

323
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:44,241
Don't play games with me.

324
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,201
It'll cost you dearly.

325
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,321
I don't appreciate being called a liar.

326
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,241
Especially when I'm telling the truth.

327
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:00,241
You're not afraid of me.

328
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,561
I've had to deal with criminals
in the past.

329
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,001
And I've never been afraid.

330
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:11,641
Why should a woman as rich as Lady Kant
have a fake diamond?

331
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:16,121
I secretly sold the real one
when Lord Kant was still alive.

332
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:17,921
Why?

333
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:21,081
I needed the money.

334
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,521
Why?

335
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,081
Answer.

336
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:39,041
I was being blackmailed by
the Johannesburg mob.

337
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:43,521
I couldn't permit my husband to find out
certain things about my past.

338
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,801
Who has the diamond now?

339
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,241
I don't know.

340
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:52,041
I sold it through an intermediary,
but I don't know to whom.

341
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:56,881
A woman like you is capable of lying
without batting an eyelash.

342
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,321
It's easy to discover the truth.

343
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,161
Take the diamond and have it examined.

344
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:14,721
I will.

345
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:19,881
- But if you're lying...
- You'll come back to kill me.

346
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:21,921
Right?

347
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,361
Yes.

348
00:36:24,321 --> 00:36:26,761
No one plays games with me and lives.

349
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:31,401
But if I'm telling the truth,
please give it back to me.

350
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:35,641
I'm invited to an important reception.

351
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:39,681
I want to wear it to be
the most beautiful.

352
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,201
The most admired.

353
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:47,801
You don't need a diamond for that.

354
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:54,881
Walter.

355
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:56,601
Why did you scream?

356
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,641
Oh God, I was so afraid!

357
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,561
- What's going on?
- Was that you outside?

358
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:06,801
Of course it was me. I just got back.

359
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,521
No, no, no...
At the end of the garden...

360
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:11,521
There...

361
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,761
There was...

362
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:15,401
Something rose up from the lawn
and then...

363
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:18,761
And then a man came out from
under the ground!

364
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:22,881
A man from under the ground?

365
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,041
Yes!

366
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,401
Does that sound possible?

367
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:29,641
But I saw him!

368
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:47,561
Where?

369
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,601
There!

370
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,681
By the bushes.

371
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:54,881
It's very dark over there.

372
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,161
How could you have seen anyone?

373
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,361
Well, I didn't... see him clearly.

374
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,601
It was more...

375
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,081
A shadow.

376
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,241
Yes!

377
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,041
It's full of shadows down there.

378
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:24,681
I think it's obvious you let
your imagination get the better of you.

379
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:32,241
Or am I supposed to believe
that you really saw...

380
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:35,481
a ghost come out of the ground?

381
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,321
You're right.

382
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:56,801
- Do you feel better now?
- Yes.

383
00:42:58,121 --> 00:42:59,121
Good.

384
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,521
Let's go to bed
and forget about the whole thing.

385
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,321
Forget these ugly thoughts.

386
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:56,881
Roberto?

387
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,721
Can you come here a second, please?

388
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,561
Good morning, Lady Kant.

389
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:11,961
Good morning.

390
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:14,441
Thank you for breakfast.

391
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:16,361
Just doing my job.

392
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,041
Do you know Diabolik?

393
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:24,681
I've heard of him.

394
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,921
The same as everyone else, I imagine.

395
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,801
- But you've never met him?
- Luckily for me, no.

396
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,841
How can you be so certain,
if no one knows what he looks like?

397
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,241
Forgive me, Lady Kant,

398
00:44:39,161 --> 00:44:42,001
I don't understand why
you're asking me all these questions.

399
00:44:57,521 --> 00:44:59,561
Because I'd like to meet him.

400
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,881
You're not afraid of him?

401
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:04,561
No.

402
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:09,361
You understand that meeting Diabolik
means meeting death?

403
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:12,241
I'll take that risk.

404
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:14,921
As you wish.

405
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:27,921
But now I can no longer allow you to go.

406
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:30,281
I don't want to.

407
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:07,561
But I saw him.

408
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:10,921
I saw him.

409
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,361
I know I saw him.

410
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,681
I saw him!

411
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:08,241
Incredible.

412
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:11,361
With these masks you can become anyone.

413
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:16,841
Hold on.

414
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:20,641
The only people to know
that the ring was in the safe, were me,

415
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:23,481
the hotel manager...

416
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,321
and that inspector.

417
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:29,721
Ginko.

418
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:35,481
Of course!
That was you in the hotel in Bellair.

419
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:48,081
You completely fooled me.

420
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:50,321
What is it?

421
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,601
You're wondering if you can trust me.

422
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,161
You're the first person I've let see
my real face.

423
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:00,561
That was your decision.

424
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:03,921
Why did you do it?
You still don't know if you can trust me.

425
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:05,801
You know too much, I'm sorry.

426
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:08,121
Either I follow my heart and trust you,

427
00:49:08,521 --> 00:49:10,481
or trust my logic and kill you.

428
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,601
At this point
I'd like to know more about you.

429
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:19,001
What's your name?

430
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:20,761
Walter Dorian.

431
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:23,241
But it's a false identity.

432
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,321
Who are you really?

433
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:31,441
I don't talk about that. Don't insist.

434
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,801
All right.

435
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:34,801
All right.

436
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:39,921
Let's change the subject.

437
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:44,281
Have you got a woman?

438
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,641
Hello, Police?

439
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:52,401
Do you love her?

440
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:55,641
I'll leave her some money
and disappear from her life.

441
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:57,881
What about you?

442
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:01,561
I'm engaged.

443
00:50:01,881 --> 00:50:02,801
To whom?

444
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:04,601
Giorgio Caron.

445
00:50:06,801 --> 00:50:08,721
The Deputy Minister of Justice?

446
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:11,441
What did you imagine was going to happen?

447
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,521
What are you talking about?

448
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,881
This evening,
as you were coming to my house.

449
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:24,841
What did you imagine was going to happen?

450
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,561
An evening with friends, nothing more.

451
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,121
Eva, you know well
that I'm in love with you.

452
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:39,921
You've known since we met in South Africa,
when your husband was still alive.

453
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:42,001
Don't talk nonsense.

454
00:50:42,721 --> 00:50:43,961
Nonsense?

455
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:47,801
Then why,
when you found yourself in trouble,

456
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,481
did you come to me?

457
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,921
You hardly knew me.

458
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:56,401
And yet you understood
that this poor imbecile...

459
00:50:57,241 --> 00:50:59,041
was in love with you,

460
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,401
and would've done anything to help you.

461
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:07,521
What do you want, Giorgio?

462
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,241
What any man in love would want.

463
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:15,921
To marry the woman he loves
and make her happy.

464
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:20,241
But I don't love you.

465
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:22,281
Do you love him?

466
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,641
I thought he was a friend.

467
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:27,081
But you loved Lord Kant, didn't you?

468
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:31,881
- You're becoming unpleasant.
- Answer me.

469
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:37,121
Did you marry that old man for love...

470
00:51:38,321 --> 00:51:39,721
or convenience?

471
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:44,121
And to think, he was the intermediary
who sold the Pink Diamond for me.

472
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,641
A deputy minister doing deals
with the South African mob.

473
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:54,601
Lady Kant has no need to marry
a deputy minister.

474
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:59,241
What Lady Kant doesn't need

475
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:02,921
is an investigation into
a certain presumed hunting accident,

476
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:06,001
which left her widowed...

477
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:09,201
and wealthy.

478
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:13,601
You know well I asked for your help

479
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:17,001
to avoid having the Kant name
dragged through an investigation.

480
00:52:22,721 --> 00:52:24,201
Perhaps, yes.

481
00:52:25,201 --> 00:52:29,441
Fortunately, no one knew who Eva Kant was

482
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,081
before she became a lady.

483
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,521
What are you talking about?

484
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:41,001
Some people still remember you
at The Blue Horse.

485
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:44,241
The Blue Horse?

486
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:46,041
Yes.

487
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,161
Have you forgotten?

488
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:51,001
The night-club where you used to perform.

489
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,161
Peter Sorel.

490
00:52:54,121 --> 00:52:55,401
Remember him?

491
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,561
He was a gangster.

492
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:02,721
And you worked for him.

493
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:07,721
Or should we talk about Protocol KD-26?

494
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,041
Industrial espionage is a crime.
You know that, don't you?

495
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,481
You made inquiries about me.

496
00:53:17,081 --> 00:53:18,201
Naturally!

497
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,321
Did you imagine I would have helped you
without knowing who you were?

498
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:25,841
I have a file on you in my safe.

499
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:28,921
Why?

500
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,001
You didn't answer my question.

501
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,721
Do you love him?

502
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,041
I detest him.

503
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:46,401
Sit down.

504
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:04,201
On the 11th of next month,

505
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,721
it'll be one year
since your husband's death.

506
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:09,401
The next day, we'll throw a big party.

507
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:13,241
The kind you like: extravagant, lavish!

508
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,681
And we'll announce our engagement.

509
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:25,041
I'm waiting for you to say yes, Eva.

510
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:30,041
Yes.

511
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,001
Good.

512
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:38,641
I'll have a surprise for you
that'll leave you breathless.

513
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:40,441
You'll see.

514
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:43,881
I love you, Eva.

515
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:47,801
I love you.

516
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:53,521
I love you.

517
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:56,001
I want you.

518
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,921
I want you now.

519
00:54:58,281 --> 00:54:59,081
Now...

520
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,121
If I have to be your fiancée, I will.

521
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:09,281
But don't ever dare to touch me again!

522
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,761
I can't breathe!

523
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:15,401
It'll pass.

524
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:21,401
He's a coward.

525
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,081
I'll get that file.

526
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:27,041
For you.

527
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:31,601
So you can continue to be
the beautiful Lady Kant.

528
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:34,201
Hold on...

529
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:39,601
You've decided not to kill me.

530
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,921
So now you trust me?

531
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:48,761
I don't know you well enough
to be certain,

532
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:52,001
but I know I'll never meet
another woman like you.

533
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:03,681
What now?

534
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:08,201
- I'll take care of Caron.
- How?

535
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:10,161
I'll take his place.

536
00:56:10,961 --> 00:56:12,441
Will you have to kill him?

537
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:17,841
Only if necessary.

538
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:45,401
Good morning, Miss Gay.
Inspector Ginko.

539
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:49,641
The severed head! Oh God!

540
00:56:49,881 --> 00:56:51,201
Please, help me!

541
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:54,601
- Maris, take her inside.
- At once.

542
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:56,401
- Stay with her.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:56:56,561 --> 00:57:00,561
Don't allow her out for any reason.
If necessary, give her a sedative.

544
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:02,961
Inspector, what came over her?

545
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:05,721
I don't know. But this could be it.

546
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:11,961
Clear the road.
Get all the cars out of sight.

547
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:13,361
Yes, sir.

548
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:19,601
As you are aware,
Mrs Eva Kant is a guest at your hotel.

549
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,881
She's my fiancée.

550
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:26,241
I'm entrusting her to your care.

551
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:29,081
I presume I don't need to add
anything else?

552
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:33,641
Ah, our engagement hasn't yet
been officially announced.

553
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:35,881
I'm relying on your discretion.

554
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,361
Eugenio.

555
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,961
- Is Roberto still with Lady Kant?
- As far as I am aware.

556
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:44,601
How is that possible?
He took her breakfast over an hour ago.

557
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,561
He's probably just
being the lady's man again, sir.

558
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,961
What's more,
if he's still in there, maybe Lady Kant...

559
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:54,201
Lady Kant what? Mind what you say!

560
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:57,801
I'm not saying anything!
But if I were you, I'd make sure...

561
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:00,001
Get back to work! Go!

562
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:13,001
- When will I see you again?
- As soon as I have the file.

563
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:15,121
- When will that be?
- Tomorrow.

564
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,521
- So soon?
- At midday.

565
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:19,441
Go to Bellavita Café.

566
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:22,281
A man will approach you and say:

567
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:26,761
"Lady Kant,
your eyes are the colour of emeralds."

568
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,001
It'll be me.

569
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,561
Are you making fun of me?

570
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:36,161
Why should I?

571
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:38,881
I know men like you.

572
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:44,001
They show up, take what they want,
make promises, then disappear.

573
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,721
What do you mean?

574
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:50,201
You may not come.

575
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:54,361
And I don't want to be
left waiting there like an idiot.

576
00:58:55,081 --> 00:58:58,161
You don't know me: my word is my word.

577
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:00,401
I'll be there.

578
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:05,241
The wardrobe.

579
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,241
Coming.

580
00:59:27,361 --> 00:59:30,161
Sorry for disturbing you, Lady Kant.
May I?

581
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:31,881
Please.

582
00:59:34,201 --> 00:59:36,561
- Did you happen to see Roberto?
- Yes.

583
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:39,641
He was here earlier.
He brought me breakfast and then left.

584
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,961
That's strange,
reception told me he was still here.

585
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,001
- They were obviously mistaken.
- Yes, obviously.

586
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:50,881
Roberto may have left
a bunch of keys here.

587
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,721
By mistake, obviously.
Do you mind if I take a look?

588
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,001
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

589
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:18,721
DO YOU KNOW MORSE CODE?

590
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:21,641
YES

591
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:31,161
COME OUT WHEN I TELL YOU

592
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:33,281
He must have left them elsewhere.

593
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:37,201
Since I'm here,
I might as well check the linen.

594
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:38,801
It'll only take a second.

595
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,481
- Of course.
- Most kind.

596
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,321
- Sir!
- Yes?

597
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:44,601
You forgot to look in the bathroom.

598
01:00:44,761 --> 01:00:46,481
- Pardon?
- For the keys.

599
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:49,441
Roberto gave it a quick clean,
perhaps he left them there.

600
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:53,601
- Well, it's really not that important.
- But isn't that why you came?

601
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,761
Please, check.

602
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,921
You're right. I'll check.

603
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:11,041
Remember: tomorrow at midday.

604
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,601
Palmer.

605
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,001
Inspector!

606
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:51,121
Over here.

607
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:02,121
It's you.

608
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:04,321
The severed head.

609
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,401
Don't touch it, Florian!
Nobody touches a thing.

610
01:02:07,961 --> 01:02:10,001
With Diabolik, you can never be sure.

611
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:16,441
Inspector, these faces are perfect.
What does Diabolik do with them?

612
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,561
We'll ask him.

613
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:08,521
POLICE

614
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:11,481
BUREAUCRATS

615
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:13,681
BANKERS

616
01:03:15,161 --> 01:03:16,481
JEWELLERS

617
01:03:17,841 --> 01:03:19,441
POLITICIANS

618
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:23,321
MINISTERS, DEPUTY MINISTERS,
UNDER-SECRETARIES

619
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:39,521
GIORGIO CARON
DEPUTY MINISTER

620
01:03:43,601 --> 01:03:44,921
Car approaching.

621
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,601
Never mind, it looks like a family.

622
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,361
Roger that, the car didn't stop.

623
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:55,361
Good. Hold your positions.

624
01:03:57,241 --> 01:04:00,401
Inspector, it's two in the morning.
Do you still think Diabolik will show up?

625
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:03,641
We're not moving from here, Palmer.
Even if we have to wait a year.

626
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:26,121
Inspector, another car's approaching.

627
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:31,881
Single male occupant.

628
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:33,801
Serra, can you see it?

629
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:36,401
No, the road's empty.

630
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:39,241
Impossible, he has to pass that way.

631
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:42,361
- Inspector, no one's coming.
- Then check it out!

632
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:43,921
- Quickly!
- I'm going.

633
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:49,081
Inspector, a hedge moved!

634
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:51,361
It's him! From now on radio silence.

635
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:53,321
Get ready.

636
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:28,841
One false move and I shoot.

637
01:05:29,881 --> 01:05:31,201
Raise your hands.

638
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:39,921
Don't move.

639
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:49,561
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

640
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,161
Freeze!

641
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:55,961
Damn!

642
01:05:56,521 --> 01:05:57,801
Hands up.

643
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:02,001
Handcuffs.

644
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:09,481
Florian, the car.

645
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:10,921
Yes, sir.

646
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,321
- Miss!
- Let go of me!

647
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:21,241
- Miss, stop!
- Walter!

648
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:23,121
Walter.

649
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:06,881
I'll bring you the bill.

650
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:12,521
Miss.

651
01:07:13,441 --> 01:07:14,881
Another tea?

652
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,321
Yes, thank you.

653
01:07:30,321 --> 01:07:32,521
- Did you hear the news?
- What's happened?

654
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,521
Here, look for yourself!

655
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:36,481
Amazing!

656
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:38,001
He's been caught.

657
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:40,801
A great success for Inspector Ginko!

658
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:51,841
DIABOLIK ARRESTED!

659
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,721
It's him!

660
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:15,161
- The guillotine!
- Murderer!

661
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:16,481
Thief!

662
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,441
Hang him!

663
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:22,681
Monster!

664
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:31,961
Hang him!

665
01:08:32,561 --> 01:08:34,161
Silence in the courtroom!

666
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:38,361
Today we begin a trial
that is destined go down in history.

667
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:41,241
The defendant, Mr Walter Dorian,

668
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:45,561
presuming that is his real name
as we have no paperwork to prove it,

669
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,961
is accused of being Diabolik,

670
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:51,041
the criminal
who has been terrorising Clerville.

671
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,681
A merciless thief and murderer,

672
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:56,721
who has committed crimes for which
no mitigating factors exist.

673
01:08:56,881 --> 01:08:58,121
HOW CAN I HELP?

674
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,561
This court is now in session.

675
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:15,801
Your Honour, the accused has refused
the right to legal representation.

676
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:19,161
- Did he state that himself?
- No, he remains absolutely silent.

677
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,441
- He refuses to say a word, therefore...
- I understand.

678
01:09:22,681 --> 01:09:25,481
Try to find him
the first available public defender.

679
01:09:45,001 --> 01:09:53,721
HOW CAN I HELP?

680
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:11,201
- I request a psychiatric assessment
for my client. -Your Honour.

681
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:15,441
If I may remind my colleague,
the accused has already been assessed,

682
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,761
and declared fully aware of
his actions and their consequences.

683
01:10:19,201 --> 01:10:20,401
Really?

684
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,001
By who?

685
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,241
The court psychiatrist.

686
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:27,601
Members of the jury, look!

687
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:30,721
He is unable to stop
his eyelids from blinking!

688
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:33,761
A clear sign of mental illness.

689
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:45,881
VIA DEI FABBRI

690
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:55,161
THIRD BRICK TO THE LEFT

691
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,321
Diabolik is a master of manipulation.

692
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:17,001
He's capable of tricking
and bending to his will

693
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:19,561
even those people above all suspicion.

694
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:23,801
No.

695
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:27,801
I never saw anything
that could have led me to understand.

696
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:34,761
He was the man I loved.

697
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:36,521
That's all I know.

698
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:47,361
THE ROAD TO PAPIGNAN 37KM

699
01:11:55,521 --> 01:12:01,121
Your Honour, the fact that my client's
identity and nationality remain unknown

700
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:06,841
does not automatically mean
that he is the infamous Diabolik.

701
01:12:07,401 --> 01:12:10,761
It is the public prosecutor's job
to prove this accusation.

702
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:13,921
Beyond any reasonable doubt!

703
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:22,161
Your Honour,
may I show some items to the court?

704
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:23,481
Proceed.

705
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:47,761
This outfit was found in
the cave under Villa Dorian.

706
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:53,401
And this rare photograph of Diabolik
was captured

707
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:55,841
by a security camera
during one of his robberies.

708
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:59,081
As you can see, the outfits are identical.

709
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:04,641
TAKE THE YELLOW AND GREEN VIALS

710
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:09,881
We now await tomorrow's verdict
in the case against Diabolik.

711
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,561
There doesn't appear to be much doubt
about what that verdict will be.

712
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:18,321
In the name of the people of Clerville,
this court declares the accused

713
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:19,841
guilty!

714
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:43,361
The death sentence will be carried out
at Ronson Prison the day after tomorrow.

715
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:44,921
And without doubt,

716
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:48,601
the moment the guillotine blade
drops on Diabolik,

717
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:52,361
the entire population of Clerville
will breathe a sigh of relief.

718
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:57,281
- I wish to speak with Mr Giorgio Caron.
- The Deputy Minister of Justice?

719
01:13:57,481 --> 01:13:58,521
Precisely.

720
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:03,401
Here you go, lovely lady.

721
01:14:03,641 --> 01:14:06,801
Fill out this form
and we'll let you know if and when

722
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:09,441
the Deputy Minister can see you.

723
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:14,921
Call him.

724
01:14:15,481 --> 01:14:17,241
Tell him Lady Kant is here.

725
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:19,841
No calls, Flora,
I don't want to be disturbed.

726
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:21,361
Very well, Mr Caron.

727
01:14:27,441 --> 01:14:30,041
I tried to call you at the hotel
numerous times.

728
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:32,601
You were never in.

729
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:35,041
Or else you pretended not to be.

730
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:37,681
I'm here now.

731
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:41,401
To apologise for
your exaggerated reaction, I hope.

732
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:45,481
We should both apologise, don't you think?

733
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:49,481
You want me to apologise to you?

734
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,321
Maybe you don't understand, Eva.

735
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:58,201
There's no way I'll accept your refusal.
Not a chance.

736
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:00,441
I swear to God...

737
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,081
if you do I'll destroy you.

738
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:06,081
Giorgio, Giorgio...

739
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:09,201
Still making threats?

740
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:14,521
Have you still not understood
that to conquer a woman like me

741
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:16,561
you have to do the exact opposite?

742
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:18,801
You have to make me dream.

743
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:22,481
If you think I'm not rich enough,
you're wrong.

744
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:24,761
I'm a very powerful man.

745
01:15:27,081 --> 01:15:28,961
It's not a question of money.

746
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:31,841
Or power.

747
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,081
What is it then?

748
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:36,361
Emotions.

749
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:40,521
Make my heart jump.

750
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,641
Give me moments I'll remember
for the rest of my life.

751
01:15:49,281 --> 01:15:51,361
That could make me fall in love.

752
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:54,961
I can give you anything you desire.

753
01:15:55,641 --> 01:15:56,921
I don't think so.

754
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,641
At least not anymore.

755
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:02,201
What a shame.

756
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,561
Goodbye forever, Giorgio.

757
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:09,801
And if you want to denounce me...

758
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:12,361
go ahead.

759
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,241
No, wait!

760
01:16:14,401 --> 01:16:17,601
- Wait! Give me another chance!
- It's too late.

761
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,601
It's not too late. I'm begging you.

762
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,841
Put me to the test.

763
01:16:23,521 --> 01:16:25,801
I'm willing to do anything for you.

764
01:16:35,561 --> 01:16:37,601
Is this today's paper?

765
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,201
Yes, why?

766
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:45,121
GUILLOTINE AWAITS DIABOLIK

767
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:46,601
Got it.

768
01:16:47,401 --> 01:16:50,001
Seeing that you are
the Deputy Minister of Justice...

769
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:54,201
arrange for me to meet Diabolik tonight.

770
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:56,721
Meet Diabolik tonight?

771
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:58,401
Whatever for?

772
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:02,641
It says he's the greatest criminal
in the history of Clerville.

773
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:07,281
It would be extraordinary to meet him
the night before his execution.

774
01:17:07,881 --> 01:17:09,761
To me, it sounds like madness.

775
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:13,241
Whereas blackmailing me was normal?

776
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:16,241
- What's that got to do with it?
- Forget it, Giorgio.

777
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:19,081
You just proved you're not prepared
to do anything for me.

778
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:22,561
Maybe you don't want to,
or maybe you're not powerful enough.

779
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:24,681
In any case, farewell.

780
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:29,041
Fine! Fine!

781
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:32,481
I'll let you meet him.

782
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:35,041
But not by yourself.

783
01:17:35,641 --> 01:17:37,521
I'm coming with you.

784
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:47,641
Warden, this lady,
whose name I obviously cannot disclose,

785
01:17:47,921 --> 01:17:49,961
is a Secret Service agent.

786
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:51,681
I understand.

787
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:55,641
What can I do for you, sir?

788
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,521
We have to interrogate Diabolik.

789
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:01,721
May I ask why?

790
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,441
We suspect him to have information
relevant to national security.

791
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:08,081
National security!

792
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:10,881
Yes, so...

793
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,521
Excuse me.

794
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:16,521
This meeting must remain
absolutely top secret.

795
01:18:17,321 --> 01:18:20,281
Therefore, if there are any microphones,
switch them off.

796
01:18:20,441 --> 01:18:21,481
All right.

797
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:24,081
I'll do as you say, but I tell you now...

798
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:27,001
in my opinion, this meeting is pointless.

799
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:30,001
- And why would that be?
- Sir...

800
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:34,161
as soon as the prisoner
was sentenced to death

801
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:38,041
he fell into a state
that I can only define as catatonic.

802
01:18:40,481 --> 01:18:43,041
He doesn't eat or speak.

803
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:45,121
He doesn't react to stimuli.

804
01:18:56,041 --> 01:19:00,801
I can only presume that he fell into
an extreme form of depression,

805
01:19:01,081 --> 01:19:03,921
triggered by the awareness
of his imminent death.

806
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:08,641
Stand.

807
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:10,201
Walk.

808
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,041
Diabolik.

809
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:18,961
Diabolik!

810
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,401
Come on, do a trick for me.

811
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:22,961
Diabolik! Oh!

812
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:24,121
Hey!

813
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:27,881
- The warden's down there. Let's go.
- Start walking.

814
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:39,001
Diabolik! Get me out of here!

815
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:42,201
This way.

816
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:48,241
Sit.

817
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:57,201
Thank you, men. You can leave.

818
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:10,761
Sir, what I'm allowing you to do
is extremely informal in nature.

819
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,601
Please be quick.

820
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:15,281
This won't take long.

821
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:17,921
When you're done, bang on the door.

822
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:21,041
Close it! Close it!

823
01:20:56,081 --> 01:20:57,121
Well?

824
01:20:58,481 --> 01:20:59,561
How did it go?

825
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,241
You were right.
It was like talking to the wall.

826
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:03,961
At least we tried.

827
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:05,521
After you.

828
01:21:06,441 --> 01:21:07,681
Stand up.

829
01:21:08,081 --> 01:21:09,921
This way. Walk.

830
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,161
This way.

831
01:22:33,641 --> 01:22:36,041
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

832
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:57,801
Good morning, Mr Caron.
I've prepared your post.

833
01:22:57,961 --> 01:23:01,001
I haven't got the time now, Flora.
I'll look at it later.

834
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:26,801
Inspector, in less than a minute
your battle with Diabolik will be over.

835
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:31,681
History will remember Diabolik
as the most feared criminal of all time.

836
01:23:32,401 --> 01:23:35,681
What an incredible man.
His indifference is terrifying.

837
01:23:35,841 --> 01:23:38,081
Even in the face of death,
he remains ice-cold.

838
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:42,481
Do you say so? I think he's afraid.

839
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:45,161
He's been that way for days.

840
01:23:46,081 --> 01:23:48,001
Like he's been struck dumb.

841
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:51,281
That's true.

842
01:23:51,721 --> 01:23:53,761
His gaze is dull, unresponsive.

843
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:56,001
As though he's on drugs.

844
01:24:08,281 --> 01:24:09,241
No!

845
01:24:18,841 --> 01:24:20,001
It's a mask!

846
01:24:20,161 --> 01:24:21,801
It's Giorgio Caron!

847
01:24:22,841 --> 01:24:25,761
The Deputy Minister of Justice
has been decapitated!

848
01:24:55,561 --> 01:24:56,481
Sir,

849
01:24:57,001 --> 01:25:00,841
what I'm allowing you to do
is extremely informal in nature.

850
01:25:01,641 --> 01:25:03,681
Please be quick.

851
01:25:03,841 --> 01:25:07,001
- This won't take long.
- When you're done, bang on the door.

852
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:09,561
Close it! Close it!

853
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:28,241
Eva...

854
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:36,201
Eva, the picklock.

855
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,481
The pentothal is starting to work.

856
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:02,761
Now he'll answer my questions.

857
01:26:07,721 --> 01:26:11,281
Where do you keep your file on Eva Kant?

858
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:17,361
The safe in my office.

859
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,721
The combination?

860
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:24,841
Four, six, seven, eight.

861
01:26:25,441 --> 01:26:26,961
We have to hurry.

862
01:26:27,121 --> 01:26:28,281
Wait.

863
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:35,681
Is there anything precious in the safe?

864
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:38,441
The key to my treasure.

865
01:26:39,121 --> 01:26:40,601
What treasure?

866
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,401
Jewels, diamonds,

867
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:45,761
gold ingots.

868
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:49,161
The fruit of my blackmail.

869
01:26:50,281 --> 01:26:52,401
- I am a very...
- Silence.

870
01:26:53,961 --> 01:26:56,641
What does the key open?

871
01:26:57,481 --> 01:27:01,321
Safe deposit box 1325,

872
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:05,721
in the vault of the Central Bank of Ghenf.

873
01:27:07,841 --> 01:27:09,681
Eva, the scopolamine.

874
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:24,921
Incredible.

875
01:27:25,081 --> 01:27:28,801
I saw the Deputy Minister leave
the interrogation cell with my own eyes!

876
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:33,041
It wasn't enough just to escape;
he wants us to think him dead.

877
01:27:33,201 --> 01:27:35,161
But you discovered the truth, Inspector.

878
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:36,641
And he doesn't know.

879
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:40,681
We have to take full advantage.
News of this mustn't get out.

880
01:27:40,841 --> 01:27:43,041
But what'll we do
with Giorgio Caron's body?

881
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:45,521
Can you keep it here,
until tomorrow at least?

882
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:48,041
That's a decision
I'm not authorised to make.

883
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:50,601
But if you want, I'll ask.

884
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,881
We have to discover the identity
of the woman who helped him escape.

885
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,881
Until the news gets out,
she has no reason to go into hiding.

886
01:28:01,241 --> 01:28:05,201
- From the warden's description,
she's not the type to go unnoticed. - No.

887
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:08,641
And Caron must have known her well
if he trusted her so much.

888
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,961
We'll talk to friends,
relations, colleagues.

889
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,321
- Maybe someone met her.
- How should I proceed?

890
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:18,361
We'll split up. Meanwhile send
two men to Caron's office and home.

891
01:28:18,521 --> 01:28:19,721
Very well, Inspector.

892
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:21,161
- Florian!
- Sergeant.

893
01:28:24,161 --> 01:28:26,681
Inspector, we've been given authorisation.

894
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:30,961
So we're in agreement:
officially, Diabolik is dead.

895
01:28:31,401 --> 01:28:32,401
Very well.

896
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:46,281
TOP SECRET

897
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:27,841
Inspector Ginko, Clerville Police Force.

898
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:30,681
I need to talk to
Deputy Minister Caron's office.

899
01:29:33,161 --> 01:29:35,121
Hello? Yes.

900
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:37,401
Inspector Ginko?

901
01:29:38,481 --> 01:29:39,801
What does he want?

902
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:43,361
All right, put him through.

903
01:29:44,121 --> 01:29:46,841
- Inspector, how can I help you?
- Hello, ma'am.

904
01:29:47,001 --> 01:29:51,441
I need your help in a delicate matter
which requires the utmost discretion.

905
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:54,641
- I'll do what I can.
- We're looking for someone.

906
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:57,681
A woman, and we know
the Deputy Minister knows her.

907
01:29:57,841 --> 01:29:59,361
You can ask him yourself, he's here.

908
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:01,281
- I'll put you through.
- No, wait!

909
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:03,201
Listen very carefully.

910
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:06,161
I'm sorry, Inspector, wait for what?
I don't understand.

911
01:30:06,321 --> 01:30:08,041
Two of my men are on their way.

912
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:09,761
Leave the office calmly,

913
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:12,441
approach them and tell them
that Diabolik is there.

914
01:30:12,881 --> 01:30:14,921
Diabolik? Where?

915
01:30:15,121 --> 01:30:17,561
Do as I say, ma'am.
I'll explain everything later.

916
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:20,201
Speak only to my men. Understand?

917
01:30:20,361 --> 01:30:21,441
All right, all right.

918
01:30:31,721 --> 01:30:32,681
Sir?

919
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:52,641
Leaving already, sir?

920
01:31:28,241 --> 01:31:29,321
Go quickly.

921
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:39,801
What happened?

922
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:44,041
I got the file, but it's pointless
trying to hide your past.

923
01:31:44,721 --> 01:31:45,601
Why?

924
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:47,561
Ginko knows I'm alive.

925
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:50,241
It won't take him long
to find out who helped me.

926
01:31:50,681 --> 01:31:51,681
Ma'am?

927
01:31:57,281 --> 01:31:58,801
Are you here, ma'am?

928
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:01,801
Where is she?

929
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:09,881
Hey!

930
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:12,161
Ma'am!

931
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,241
Ma'am! Everything all right?

932
01:32:25,761 --> 01:32:27,201
Where to now?

933
01:32:27,481 --> 01:32:28,481
Ghenf.

934
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:33,201
Do you still plan on walking into the bank
disguised as Caron?

935
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:34,521
I can't.

936
01:32:35,721 --> 01:32:37,721
And we won't be needing this anymore.

937
01:32:41,721 --> 01:32:43,561
But I'm not giving up on the heist.

938
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:50,041
A blonde with her hair in a chignon?
That's Eva Kant.

939
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:51,761
Eva Kant.

940
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:54,321
- The heiress?
- Yes, that's her.

941
01:32:54,481 --> 01:32:56,721
She was here just the other day.

942
01:32:56,881 --> 01:32:58,801
What was her relationship to Mr Caron?

943
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:02,201
The Deputy Minister was in love with her.
Head-over-heels.

944
01:33:02,401 --> 01:33:04,841
She took advantage of him, didn't she?
Tricked him.

945
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:06,441
So it seems.

946
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:09,721
Inspector, the safe doesn't show
signs of being forced.

947
01:33:10,041 --> 01:33:11,441
How did Diabolik open it?

948
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:13,681
He clearly knew the combination.

949
01:33:14,401 --> 01:33:16,121
We need to find out what he took.

950
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:18,161
Come with me, ma'am.

951
01:33:21,601 --> 01:33:23,521
Check if anything's missing.

952
01:33:27,801 --> 01:33:31,321
I'm not sure.
It was the Deputy Minister's safe.

953
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:36,881
As far as I know, he usually kept
work files and important documents in it.

954
01:33:37,081 --> 01:33:40,601
Might he recently have put
something of considerable value in it?

955
01:33:40,761 --> 01:33:43,881
Perhaps jewels,
or a significant amount of cash.

956
01:33:44,481 --> 01:33:48,321
As far as I'm aware, no.
And if I may, it sounds strange to me.

957
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:50,001
Why?

958
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:52,761
The Deputy Minister held
a good position and led a nice life,

959
01:33:52,921 --> 01:33:54,681
but he wasn't a wealthy man.

960
01:33:55,961 --> 01:33:58,161
I understand.
Thank you, ma'am, you may go home.

961
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:02,281
But, please, the maximum discretion.
Don't tell anyone what has happened.

962
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:03,641
Mixon.

963
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:08,041
- Accompany the lady.
- This way, ma'am.

964
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:11,161
I can't go home.
I still have paperwork to finish.

965
01:34:11,321 --> 01:34:14,281
Ma'am, we're sealing the office.
No one is allowed in here.

966
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,641
Thank you again, goodbye.

967
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:18,601
Goodbye.

968
01:34:21,841 --> 01:34:24,081
Catalogue the contents of the safe.

969
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:26,401
As you wish, Inspector,

970
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:28,361
but it seems a waste of time to me.

971
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:32,401
- Diabolik will have taken what he wanted.
- No, Palmer, we can't be sure of that.

972
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,001
Come on, let's start the search.

973
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:11,761
Inspector!

974
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:15,961
Inspector, look what I found.
Hidden behind the radiator.

975
01:35:16,801 --> 01:35:17,761
Look.

976
01:35:19,321 --> 01:35:20,481
The transcript of a call

977
01:35:20,641 --> 01:35:23,361
between Bolten the jeweler
and the South African Ambassador.

978
01:35:23,521 --> 01:35:26,881
They're discussing some diamonds
illegally imported by the Ambassador.

979
01:35:28,121 --> 01:35:29,641
There's even a tape.

980
01:35:32,521 --> 01:35:33,601
Look.

981
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:39,361
Some photos of a man going into a hotel
with a girl no older than 20.

982
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:43,001
This is Guido Furlan, the industrialist.
Married with children.

983
01:35:45,801 --> 01:35:47,961
From what I've seen,
it's all similar stuff.

984
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:51,041
What was Caron up to,
blackmailing all these people?

985
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:53,361
Perhaps.
He was definitely collecting dirt on them.

986
01:35:53,521 --> 01:35:56,601
Maybe this is what Diabolik
was looking for but didn't find it.

987
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:58,401
I'm not convinced.

988
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,281
There's something...

989
01:36:01,441 --> 01:36:03,321
Blackmail isn't his style.

990
01:36:22,161 --> 01:36:24,361
CENTRAL BANK OF GHENF

991
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:53,721
- Mrs Morel?
- That's right.

992
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:56,721
Ada Fanel, the manager.
Hello and welcome.

993
01:36:56,881 --> 01:36:58,121
It's my pleasure.

994
01:36:58,281 --> 01:37:00,521
- We finally get to meet.
- Indeed.

995
01:37:00,841 --> 01:37:02,321
Your precious paintings?

996
01:37:02,521 --> 01:37:05,281
- In the car.
- There they are! Chop-chop!

997
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:08,281
Their story is a romantic one,
but ever so sad.

998
01:37:08,441 --> 01:37:11,881
A young and very talented painter
without a penny to his name,

999
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:13,961
and a beautiful high society girl.

1000
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:17,921
Her family opposes their love
and forces them to split up.

1001
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:20,721
- It sounds like a novel.
- And yet it's a true story.

1002
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:23,721
- In you go, boys.
- A true story.

1003
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:25,121
- After you.
- Thank you.

1004
01:37:28,281 --> 01:37:30,081
Open up, please, Gianluca.

1005
01:37:31,201 --> 01:37:34,161
And that beautiful girl was
my grandmother.

1006
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:37,481
Goodness! Then your grandmother
and the great Tournier...

1007
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:40,001
Yes! That's right.

1008
01:37:41,401 --> 01:37:46,161
And as a parting gift,
he painted these two portraits of her.

1009
01:37:46,441 --> 01:37:49,961
Without wishing to state the obvious,
today they must be worth a fortune.

1010
01:37:50,121 --> 01:37:53,641
Yes, but I don't care about money.
That's what insurance is for!

1011
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:57,761
But these two paintings are of
immense emotional importance to me.

1012
01:37:57,921 --> 01:37:59,321
Truly immense!

1013
01:37:59,481 --> 01:38:02,601
- Just the thought of them being stolen...
- Don't worry, that won't happen.

1014
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:07,241
Our security system is
absolutely foolproof, I assure you.

1015
01:38:07,521 --> 01:38:09,441
Its genius lies in its simplicity.

1016
01:38:09,641 --> 01:38:14,361
The vault was hollowed out
from one enormous block of steel.

1017
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:19,081
The ceiling, the floor, the four walls,
all reinforced steel.

1018
01:38:19,241 --> 01:38:20,321
Impressive!

1019
01:38:20,481 --> 01:38:23,161
Between the steel walls
and exterior walls,

1020
01:38:23,321 --> 01:38:27,281
there is a cavity with a wire cage
surrounding the entire vault.

1021
01:38:27,441 --> 01:38:31,401
If anyone even touches it,
never mind tries to cut it,

1022
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:32,961
an alarm goes off,

1023
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:35,921
and the police would be here
in five minutes.

1024
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,761
So, if I've understood correctly,
it's like a three-layer cake.

1025
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:46,161
With exterior walls,
a wire cage and the steel vault, right?

1026
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:50,441
My word!
Nobody's ever getting in here!

1027
01:38:50,601 --> 01:38:52,841
Exactly. Here we are.

1028
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,521
Number 1962.

1029
01:38:57,001 --> 01:39:00,441
- This is your key.
- Thank you.

1030
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:03,001
First, I insert mine,

1031
01:39:03,161 --> 01:39:05,281
then you insert yours.

1032
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:08,801
- Like this?
- Like that.

1033
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:11,761
Three, two, one...

1034
01:39:17,481 --> 01:39:19,281
There. Proceed.

1035
01:39:45,721 --> 01:39:47,041
Where did you get them?

1036
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:51,441
In Giorgio Caron's office.
Hidden behind the toilet radiator.

1037
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:53,361
That rat.

1038
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:57,321
- Was he blackmailing you?
- Yes.

1039
01:39:58,001 --> 01:40:01,121
He wanted one million in gold ingots
for the photos.

1040
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:03,081
I was ready to pay him.

1041
01:40:04,161 --> 01:40:06,641
Well, that's no longer necessary.
Here.

1042
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:11,481
Thank you, Inspector, thank you.

1043
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:14,641
You're a true gentleman.

1044
01:40:15,441 --> 01:40:16,441
Goodbye.

1045
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:47,121
He asked one for gold ingots,
another for jewels...

1046
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,641
Caron must have a treasure
hidden away someplace.

1047
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:55,441
Now I understand why the autopsy found
traces of those two drugs in his body.

1048
01:40:55,681 --> 01:40:58,441
The scopolamine was obvious,
to deprive him of his will power.

1049
01:40:59,321 --> 01:41:02,721
Allowing us to take him to the gallows
without any resistance.

1050
01:41:02,881 --> 01:41:06,961
The pentothal was to get him to reveal
where his treasure is hidden.

1051
01:41:08,121 --> 01:41:11,521
We need to find out, too.
Before Diabolik pulls off the heist.

1052
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:14,121
It's the only way we'll catch him.

1053
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:16,841
Easier said than done, Inspector.
We searched his home and office.

1054
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:20,481
Interrogated everyone there is
to interrogate, but no one knows a thing.

1055
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:22,881
Caron was clever, I'll give him that.

1056
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:26,161
Without raising suspicion,
he blackmailed his way up the ladder

1057
01:41:26,321 --> 01:41:29,081
and accumulated a fortune
that's proving hard to track down.

1058
01:41:29,401 --> 01:41:31,761
Gold, diamonds... but never money.

1059
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:34,641
Clever but also an idiot.

1060
01:41:34,801 --> 01:41:38,001
With a safe at his disposal he went
and hid those files behind a radiator.

1061
01:41:38,481 --> 01:41:40,801
Even the cleaning lady
could have found them.

1062
01:41:42,841 --> 01:41:44,881
Have the seals removed
from Caron's office.

1063
01:41:45,201 --> 01:41:46,281
Why?

1064
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:48,001
Because you're right.

1065
01:41:48,601 --> 01:41:52,601
It doesn't make any sense to keep such
compromising documents behind a radiator.

1066
01:41:53,961 --> 01:41:56,441
Do you think someone
put them there on purpose?

1067
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,481
Exactly.

1068
01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:03,721
Someone who knew
we would've looked in the safe.

1069
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:40,361
These masks are amazing.

1070
01:42:47,081 --> 01:42:48,281
How did it go?

1071
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:52,201
The paintings are in
safe deposit box number 1962.

1072
01:42:56,561 --> 01:42:57,721
Good work.

1073
01:42:57,961 --> 01:42:59,041
It was easy.

1074
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:01,361
What now?

1075
01:43:03,201 --> 01:43:04,961
The bank shuts at five.

1076
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:08,281
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- See you tomorrow, Aldo.

1077
01:43:20,881 --> 01:43:23,481
Only two security guards remain inside.

1078
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:25,041
Everyone's out.

1079
01:43:25,201 --> 01:43:28,401
At approximately ten-past five
the guards activate the alarm

1080
01:43:28,561 --> 01:43:29,961
and turn off the lights.

1081
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:33,881
The lasers will activate
at twenty past five.

1082
01:43:41,801 --> 01:43:45,921
They will shut off after five hours,
37 minutes and 21 seconds.

1083
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:49,961
The residual heat will melt through
the final millimetres of steel.

1084
01:43:50,121 --> 01:43:54,241
But if it melts just one second early,
mightn't the laser hit the wire cage?

1085
01:43:54,401 --> 01:43:55,761
That won't happen.

1086
01:43:56,241 --> 01:43:58,321
How can you say that with such certainty?

1087
01:43:58,841 --> 01:44:01,401
I don't say it. Physics does.

1088
01:44:05,441 --> 01:44:07,801
Relax, you've done your part.

1089
01:44:10,321 --> 01:44:11,521
It's my turn now.

1090
01:44:49,401 --> 01:44:51,601
- Some tea?
- Thanks, leave it there.

1091
01:45:18,241 --> 01:45:21,521
It's a map of the water system
that runs under the bank.

1092
01:45:21,841 --> 01:45:24,721
It shows all the manholes.
See number 25?

1093
01:45:26,561 --> 01:45:27,721
Uh-huh.

1094
01:45:28,201 --> 01:45:30,161
I enter and exit through there.

1095
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:34,601
You'll have to make your way along
a completely straight section of tunnel.

1096
01:45:36,161 --> 01:45:38,081
No one will be down there at night.

1097
01:45:39,521 --> 01:45:41,201
And if someone is?

1098
01:45:42,761 --> 01:45:44,041
All the worse for him.

1099
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:47,761
In any case, the cistern isn't far.

1100
01:46:03,601 --> 01:46:06,041
Once inside,
I can work without complications.

1101
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:09,161
How is it possible
that nothing worries you?

1102
01:46:09,401 --> 01:46:11,281
A lot of things worry me.

1103
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:17,401
But for every problem,
I try to find the right solution.

1104
01:46:22,841 --> 01:46:25,721
This, for example,
will resolve the problem of the wall.

1105
01:46:33,401 --> 01:46:36,321
I just have to make sure I stop
before I touch the cage.

1106
01:46:46,961 --> 01:46:48,761
This is more straightforward.

1107
01:46:49,521 --> 01:46:52,401
I just have to prolong it
and pass it through the wire cage,

1108
01:46:52,561 --> 01:46:54,241
making sure not to touch it.

1109
01:47:16,601 --> 01:47:20,641
A few drops of acid will do
to melt the lock on the safe deposit door.

1110
01:47:31,281 --> 01:47:34,241
Have you calculated how long
it'll take to flood the vault?

1111
01:47:34,601 --> 01:47:37,081
The flow of water is
5,000 litres per minute.

1112
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:50,921
The volume of the cistern and vault
is 700 cubic metres.

1113
01:47:51,081 --> 01:47:53,921
- It'll take two and a half hours.
- Doesn't that worry you?

1114
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:06,361
Trapped in there for two and a half hours
without knowing what's going on outside.

1115
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:07,441
You're wrong.

1116
01:48:07,721 --> 01:48:09,881
I know exactly
what'll be happening outside.

1117
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:13,721
There isn't anything
I haven't taken into consideration.

1118
01:48:33,921 --> 01:48:35,161
Good evening, ma'am.

1119
01:48:38,081 --> 01:48:39,761
Were you looking for this?

1120
01:48:39,921 --> 01:48:42,761
No, Inspector, there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

1121
01:48:42,961 --> 01:48:44,601
Don't lie to me, ma'am.

1122
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:47,681
We caught you with your hands
behind the radiator.

1123
01:48:47,841 --> 01:48:50,161
I don't know why you acted so foolishly,

1124
01:48:50,321 --> 01:48:53,041
but it's obvious that you know
many of your boss's secrets.

1125
01:48:53,201 --> 01:48:55,161
Whether you are also his accomplice
remains to be seen.

1126
01:48:55,321 --> 01:48:59,721
I'm nobody's accomplice!
Search my house, check my bank account.

1127
01:48:59,881 --> 01:49:02,921
- I never took anything!
- Blackmail is a crime.

1128
01:49:03,601 --> 01:49:05,561
You knew about it, but didn't report it.

1129
01:49:05,721 --> 01:49:07,921
How could I? I'm his secretary.

1130
01:49:09,161 --> 01:49:12,161
Besides, it would've been my word
against the Deputy Minister's.

1131
01:49:13,761 --> 01:49:16,761
You removed this from the safe
so that we wouldn't find it.

1132
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:24,001
Yes... Yes, I'm sorry.

1133
01:49:24,881 --> 01:49:28,481
I panicked, I was afraid of
getting dragged into it.

1134
01:49:28,881 --> 01:49:31,681
I was stupid. Really stupid.

1135
01:49:36,881 --> 01:49:38,801
What else is missing from the safe?

1136
01:49:40,441 --> 01:49:42,001
You know, don't you?

1137
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:44,761
You know what Diabolik took.

1138
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:52,081
I don't know if he took anything else,
but of one thing I'm sure: a key.

1139
01:49:52,521 --> 01:49:53,841
A key to what?

1140
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:56,401
I don't understand why you refuse my help.

1141
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:58,081
You're not ready yet.

1142
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:00,561
I'm not ready?
Sorry for reminding you,

1143
01:50:00,721 --> 01:50:03,241
but if you still have your head
it's thanks to me.

1144
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:06,481
I've planned for every eventuality,
I don't need anyone's help.

1145
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,601
What's my role supposed to be?

1146
01:50:12,121 --> 01:50:14,441
The good wife who waits for you at home?

1147
01:50:15,881 --> 01:50:17,681
What if the police chase you?

1148
01:50:17,841 --> 01:50:20,321
Only one policeman
can cause me any trouble.

1149
01:50:20,481 --> 01:50:23,001
That's Ginko.
But right now, he's in Clerville.

1150
01:50:23,161 --> 01:50:25,481
- Damn witch!
- Contain yourself, Palmer.

1151
01:50:25,641 --> 01:50:27,521
Contain myself? How, Inspector?

1152
01:50:27,681 --> 01:50:30,161
If only she'd told us earlier
that Diabolik had taken the key

1153
01:50:30,321 --> 01:50:32,801
to a safe deposit box
in the Central Bank of Ghenf!

1154
01:50:32,961 --> 01:50:35,961
- She's made us lose days on him!
- We're still in time.

1155
01:50:36,121 --> 01:50:39,281
If Diabolik had pulled off the heist,
we would've heard by now.

1156
01:50:39,761 --> 01:50:41,641
You're right, Inspector, as always.

1157
01:50:45,001 --> 01:50:47,041
- What are you doing?
- Calling the bank.

1158
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:49,601
The security guards will still be inside,
we have to warn them.

1159
01:50:49,761 --> 01:50:51,681
Palmer, haven't you understood yet?

1160
01:50:53,561 --> 01:50:55,921
Diabolik is capable
of taking anyone's place.

1161
01:50:56,081 --> 01:50:58,161
It could be him answering the phone!

1162
01:50:58,321 --> 01:51:01,201
- What about warning the Ghenf Police?
- Everyone stays in the dark.

1163
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:04,081
- He can't discover that we know.
- So what are we going to do?

1164
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:06,441
Put a team together, we're going to Ghenf.

1165
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:57,241
When the alarm sounds,

1166
01:51:57,401 --> 01:52:00,241
the guards will check the monitors
and think...

1167
01:52:01,561 --> 01:52:03,761
There's a leak, the vault's flooding!

1168
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:05,601
And they'll deactivate the alarm.

1169
01:52:05,801 --> 01:52:07,441
- Will I turn off the alarm?
- Yes.

1170
01:52:26,921 --> 01:52:27,881
Hello?

1171
01:52:28,761 --> 01:52:30,721
What?! Sweet Jesus!

1172
01:52:31,561 --> 01:52:34,721
Call the fire brigade, at once!
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1173
01:52:35,601 --> 01:52:38,961
The fire brigade will arrive
after at most 15 to 20 minutes.

1174
01:53:07,001 --> 01:53:10,281
Lord above, this is a leak
of biblical proportions!

1175
01:53:10,441 --> 01:53:13,561
A pipe must have burst
in the toilet located inside the vault.

1176
01:53:13,721 --> 01:53:16,881
Do you reckon?
It seems a tad excessive for a toilet!

1177
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:20,401
But it can't be coming from outside.
The vault is completely sealed.

1178
01:53:20,561 --> 01:53:22,921
Solid steel, one metre thick.
It's impossible.

1179
01:53:23,081 --> 01:53:24,761
In any case, we'll have to get a move on.

1180
01:53:24,921 --> 01:53:28,681
At this rate, the water level will be
above the vault door within the hour.

1181
01:53:28,841 --> 01:53:30,881
We won't be able to open it
without flooding the bank.

1182
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:33,361
Don't worry,
the manager will soon be here.

1183
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:37,921
The only person able to open
the vault door at night is the manager.

1184
01:53:38,081 --> 01:53:40,281
But I've made sure
she won't get there in time.

1185
01:54:10,081 --> 01:54:12,121
The final problem is the monitors.

1186
01:54:14,401 --> 01:54:16,201
But the water will take care of them.

1187
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:19,721
Lord above!

1188
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:24,281
The water must have reached
the fuse box inside the vault

1189
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:27,281
and short-circuited the cameras.

1190
01:54:44,641 --> 01:54:47,881
With the cameras out of commission
I can enter without being seen.

1191
01:54:49,441 --> 01:54:52,681
I'll have all the time I need
to force open the safe deposit box,

1192
01:54:52,841 --> 01:54:54,761
without raising any suspicions.

1193
01:55:46,521 --> 01:55:49,481
Inspector Ginko, Clerville Police Force.
What's going on?

1194
01:55:49,641 --> 01:55:50,881
Logan, Fire Chief.

1195
01:55:51,041 --> 01:55:53,881
An accident, Inspector.
The bank's vault has flooded.

1196
01:55:54,041 --> 01:55:56,201
- Are you the night watchmen?
- Yes, Inspector.

1197
01:55:56,361 --> 01:55:59,481
- Why aren't you in front of the monitors?
- The cameras short-circuited.

1198
01:56:01,161 --> 01:56:03,841
Inspector, my men and I
are going down into the tunnels.

1199
01:56:04,001 --> 01:56:07,201
- No, it could be dangerous.
- Dangerous, in what way?

1200
01:56:07,361 --> 01:56:09,041
You could meet Diabolik.

1201
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:11,601
Lord above!

1202
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:13,681
But, Inspector, Diabolik's dead!

1203
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:16,561
That's what we let people believe
in order to catch him.

1204
01:56:16,961 --> 01:56:18,361
This is his work.

1205
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:20,041
He's emptying the vault.

1206
01:56:29,321 --> 01:56:32,201
- Get me the Ghenf Police.
- At once.

1207
01:56:33,081 --> 01:56:34,521
This is Ghenf Central.

1208
01:56:34,681 --> 01:56:38,241
Send all available men
to the Central Bank, now!

1209
01:56:49,521 --> 01:56:50,681
She's here!

1210
01:56:54,401 --> 01:56:55,841
You're finally here, ma'am.

1211
01:56:56,001 --> 01:56:57,921
Diabolik isn't dead,
he's emptying the vault!

1212
01:56:58,201 --> 01:56:59,441
Sweet Jesus!

1213
01:57:24,761 --> 01:57:27,761
Diabolik is inside here.
You need to get that into your heads!

1214
01:57:27,921 --> 01:57:31,121
Inspector, if we open this door,
the whole bank will be flooded.

1215
01:57:31,281 --> 01:57:34,481
- We can't have that!
- We'll pay for the damage, all right?

1216
01:57:34,921 --> 01:57:38,041
- Inspector, there's another problem.
- Which is?

1217
01:57:38,201 --> 01:57:42,441
Whoever opens this door
will be hit by a wave of such magnitude,

1218
01:57:42,601 --> 01:57:45,521
that they risk serious injury,
or even death!

1219
01:57:45,681 --> 01:57:47,481
- Precisely!
- All right.

1220
01:57:48,201 --> 01:57:50,961
Then get me a map
of the water tunnels in this area,

1221
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:53,001
with all the manholes indicated.

1222
01:57:53,721 --> 01:57:55,281
Can you do that?

1223
01:57:57,121 --> 01:57:58,001
Certainly, sir.

1224
01:58:17,401 --> 01:58:18,921
Good wife, my ass!

1225
01:58:28,921 --> 01:58:33,041
This is my city and these are my men,
don't tell me what to do!

1226
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:37,041
Inspector Driskell,
if you send your men into the tunnels,

1227
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:40,681
Diabolik will kill them
before they even realise what's going on.

1228
01:58:41,121 --> 01:58:43,841
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of Diabolik.

1229
01:58:44,361 --> 01:58:46,841
We have him trapped, he can't escape.

1230
01:58:47,881 --> 01:58:50,961
As you wish.
But be prepared to count the bodies.

1231
01:58:55,641 --> 01:58:57,361
And what do you suggest?

1232
01:58:58,401 --> 01:59:01,721
Diabolik doesn't know we're here.
We wait for him to resurface.

1233
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:16,641
This is a map of the water system
around the bank.

1234
01:59:17,121 --> 01:59:20,441
Diabolik has to come out
through one of these manholes.

1235
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:23,401
- Do you want them all watched?
- Yes.

1236
01:59:23,721 --> 01:59:26,241
Two men at every manhole, ready to shoot.

1237
01:59:26,401 --> 01:59:29,161
And place roadblocks on all access routes.

1238
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:30,721
Agreed.

1239
01:59:30,881 --> 01:59:31,881
- Florian.
- Inspector.

1240
01:59:32,041 --> 01:59:33,841
Take a man and watch the seafront.

1241
01:59:34,001 --> 01:59:35,801
Remember, absolutely no one gets by.

1242
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:55,921
- Excuse me, Officer...
- I'm sorry, miss, you can't pass.

1243
01:59:56,081 --> 01:59:58,281
- You'll have to turn back.
- Hold on, that's Eva Kant!

1244
02:00:37,121 --> 02:00:41,321
It was an honour to watch you at work,
Inspector Ginko.

1245
02:00:46,561 --> 02:00:47,721
Men!

1246
02:00:48,521 --> 02:00:49,721
Let's roll!

1247
02:00:50,441 --> 02:00:51,521
Ginko.

1248
02:01:21,561 --> 02:01:25,121
- Driskell here, who's this?
- Dalton, Inspector.

1249
02:01:25,281 --> 02:01:26,761
We've a broken streetlamp here.

1250
02:01:26,921 --> 02:01:27,841
You don't say!

1251
02:01:28,001 --> 02:01:31,721
While you're at it, make sure nobody
has dropped any rubbish on the ground!

1252
02:01:31,881 --> 02:01:33,401
What's going on, Driskell?

1253
02:01:33,561 --> 02:01:36,321
Nothing, one of my men says
there's a broken streetlamp.

1254
02:01:37,961 --> 02:01:39,601
Let me talk to him.

1255
02:01:40,401 --> 02:01:42,361
This is Ginko. What's your location?

1256
02:01:42,601 --> 02:01:45,201
On the wharf, to the left of the bank.

1257
02:01:46,601 --> 02:01:49,961
Hold your position, I'll be right there.
Palmer, you stay here.

1258
02:01:50,121 --> 02:01:52,041
- I'll come with you, Inspector.
- I said stay here.

1259
02:01:52,201 --> 02:01:54,721
What's the problem, Inspector?
Streetlamps get broken!

1260
02:01:54,881 --> 02:01:57,001
Or someone wants it not to be lit!

1261
02:01:57,601 --> 02:01:59,961
- Do you think it was Diabolik?
- I don't know.

1262
02:02:00,241 --> 02:02:03,401
But I'd better take a look.
You're in charge while I check it out.

1263
02:02:53,001 --> 02:02:54,401
Did you hear that?

1264
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:02,121
Hey!

1265
02:03:09,601 --> 02:03:10,521
Freeze!

1266
02:03:19,121 --> 02:03:20,521
The mask.

1267
02:03:31,481 --> 02:03:32,641
It's over.

1268
02:03:34,521 --> 02:03:36,841
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man.

1269
02:03:38,361 --> 02:03:39,401
You're right.

1270
02:03:39,841 --> 02:03:41,761
I'm not a killer like you.

1271
02:03:42,441 --> 02:03:46,201
No, you let the guillotine
do your dirty work.

1272
02:03:46,881 --> 02:03:49,521
I don't like it, but that's the law.

1273
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,321
Your law.

1274
02:03:51,481 --> 02:03:52,561
Everyone's.

1275
02:03:53,281 --> 02:03:55,681
Every citizen, every human being.

1276
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,481
Not mine.

1277
02:03:58,001 --> 02:03:59,681
And that's your downfall.

1278
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:02,441
You're destined to fail
because you're alone.

1279
02:04:06,761 --> 02:04:08,081
Don't move!

1280
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:14,721
That's where you're wrong, Inspector.

1281
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:17,161
I'm not alone.

1282
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:26,801
Now I've got Eva.

1283
02:04:44,361 --> 02:04:45,521
Start the motor.

1284
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:23,561
Bastard.

1285
02:05:24,801 --> 02:05:26,121
I'll get you.

1286
02:05:26,281 --> 02:05:27,481
Inspector!

1287
02:05:29,681 --> 02:05:30,841
Inspector!

1288
02:06:17,961 --> 02:06:20,201
Have you decided what to wear tonight?

1289
02:06:24,561 --> 02:06:25,721
Not yet.

1290
02:06:28,841 --> 02:06:30,201
What do you suggest?

1291
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:33,281
Something that goes with this.

1292
02:06:45,721 --> 02:06:47,601
Why should I wear a fake diamond?

1293
02:06:48,161 --> 02:06:49,641
Because it's not fake.

1294
02:06:56,681 --> 02:06:58,241
Where did you get it?

1295
02:06:58,881 --> 02:07:01,241
It was in Caron's safe deposit box.

1296
02:07:04,481 --> 02:07:05,921
Now I understand.

1297
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:09,001
The surprise that would've
left me breathless.

1298
02:07:09,681 --> 02:07:11,401
He bought it back.

1299
02:07:12,161 --> 02:07:13,481
That worm.

1300
02:07:25,001 --> 02:07:26,201
Why?

1301
02:07:28,041 --> 02:07:30,081
It belongs at the bottom of the sea.

1302
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:34,961
It represented my past.

1303
02:07:35,841 --> 02:07:37,201
Now I've got you.

1304
02:07:48,201 --> 02:07:53,401
